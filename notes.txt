* tried rolling this with our stack (our Ruby version, postgres db), we'll see if that causes trouble
* never used the rails generator for gql types before, nice feature. The stricter our conventions around
    type and resolver implementation, the better.
* We should think about whether we want a "wide" or "deep" schema: should there be many
    entry point queries or a small selective group?
* "Mutations" is a slight misnomer depending on how you look at it:
    a "mutation" is really any server action other than simply
    returning data to the client. So, this is typically a request that
    mutates the underlying data, but something like triggering an external
    API call would also potentially be a "mutation".
